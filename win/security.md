1. What are the key security principles you would follow in developing a Flutter application?
Answer:

Data Encryption: Use AES encryption for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.
Authentication: Implement strong user authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth2 or SAML.
Secure APIs: Use HTTPS with certificate pinning to secure API calls.
Input Validation: Protect against injection attacks by validating and sanitizing user inputs.
Least Privilege Principle: Restrict permissions to only what's necessary.
Code Obfuscation: Obfuscate the Dart code using tools like ProGuard or R8.

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and TLS (Transport Layer Security)
- are cryptographic technologies that help secure data in different contexts:

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
What it is: A symmetric encryption algorithm used to secure data at rest (stored data).
Key Features:
Symmetric: The same key is used for both encryption (locking the data) and decryption (unlocking the data).
Secure: Widely considered secure when using appropriate key sizes (e.g., 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit).
Fast: Optimized for performance, making it ideal for encrypting large amounts of data.
Use Cases:
Encrypting files or databases.
Protecting sensitive information in applications.
How it works: Converts plaintext into ciphertext using mathematical transformations, 
making the data unreadable without the correct key.

- TLS (Transport Layer Security)
What it is: A cryptographic protocol that ensures secure communication over networks,
- primarily used for data in transit.

Key Features:
Asymmetric & Symmetric Encryption: Uses asymmetric encryption (public/private keys) to establish a secure connection, 
then switches to symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) for faster data transmission.
Authentication: Verifies the identity of the communicating parties using certificates.
Integrity: Ensures data isn't tampered with during transit using cryptographic hashes.
Encryption: Protects data from eavesdropping.
Use Cases:
Securing web traffic (HTTPS uses TLS).
Encrypting email (e.g., SMTP with STARTTLS).
Protecting APIs or other network communications.
How it works:
A handshake establishes a secure connection and exchanges encryption keys.
Subsequent communication is encrypted using the agreed-upon keys and cipher suite.

- OAuth 2.0 and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
Both OAuth 2.0 and SAML are frameworks for authentication and authorization, 
but they are used in different contexts and solve slightly different problems. Here’s an overview:

OAuth 2.0
What it is: An open standard for authorization, primarily used to allow third-party applications 
limited access to user resources without exposing credentials.
Key Features:
Authorization (not authentication): OAuth 2.0 grants access to resources (e.g., accessing a user’s Google Drive)
without sharing the user's credentials.
Token-based: Issues an access token to the requesting application.
User Consent: Users explicitly grant permission to applications requesting access.
Flows:
Authorization Code Flow: Most secure, used in web apps.
Implicit Flow: Used for browser-based or mobile apps (less secure, less common now).
Client Credentials Flow: For server-to-server communication.
Password Grant: Deprecated due to security concerns.
Use Cases:
Login with Google/Facebook/Apple.
Allowing apps to access APIs or cloud services on behalf of users.
How it works:
The user logs in via an authorization server (e.g., Google).
The user grants the app permission to access specific resources.
The app gets an access token to call APIs on the user's behalf.
SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
What it is: An XML-based open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties 
(identity providers and service providers).
Key Features:
Authentication & Authorization: SAML focuses on verifying user identity (authentication) and passing permissions (authorization).
Single Sign-On (SSO): Enables users to log in once and access multiple services.
XML-based: Relies on XML for secure data exchange.
Parties:
Identity Provider (IdP): Authenticates the user (e.g., Okta, Active Directory).
Service Provider (SP): Provides access to the requested service (e.g., Salesforce).
Use Cases:
Enterprise applications where SSO is required.
Logging into corporate apps with a single identity (e.g., using your company's account to access multiple tools).
How it works:
The user tries to access a service provider (SP).
The SP redirects the user to the identity provider (IdP) for authentication.
The IdP authenticates the user and sends an assertion (via XML) back to the SP.
The SP grants access based on the assertion.

Summary
OAuth 2.0 is best for granting limited access to user resources in modern, web, and mobile applications.
SAML is ideal for enterprise-level Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions, enabling seamless user authentication across multiple applications.

2. How would you protect sensitive data on the user's device?
