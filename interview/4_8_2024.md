## What are the ways to add real time functionality and how to integrate it with flutter?
- To add real-time functionality to a Flutter application, you can use various methods and technologies depending on your requirements. 
- Here are some popular options:

- 1. Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that allows data to be stored and synchronized in real-time across all clients.
- Integration:
- Add the Firebase SDK to your Flutter project.
- Configure Firebase in your app using firebase_core.
- Use the firebase_database package to interact with the database.
- Listen to changes in the data using streams.

- 2. Firebase Cloud Firestore
- Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.
- Integration:
- Use the cloud_firestore package.
- Set up Firebase in your project and initialize Firebase in your Flutter app.
- Use Firestore to query data and listen to changes with snapshots.

- 3. WebSockets
- WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, which is useful for real-time data transfer.
- Integration:
- Use the web_socket_channel package to connect to a WebSocket server.
- Set up a WebSocket server (e.g., using Node.js, Django, etc.).
- Connect to the server and listen for incoming messages.

- 4. Pusher
- Pusher is a hosted service that makes it simple to add real-time data and functionality to web and mobile applications.
- Integration:
- Use the pusher_client package.
- Set up Pusher on your backend.
- Connect to the Pusher channel and bind to events to receive updates.

- 5. SignalR
- SignalR is a library for ASP.NET that adds real-time web functionality to applications.
- Integration:
- Use the signalr_core package to connect to a SignalR hub.
- Configure SignalR on the server.
- Establish a connection and listen for messages.

- 6. GraphQL Subscriptions
- GraphQL is a query language for your API, and subscriptions allow you to maintain a persistent connection to the server 
- for real-time updates.
- Integration:
- Use the graphql_flutter package.
- Set up a GraphQL server that supports subscriptions.
- Use the web_socket_link for real-time data.

- 7. MQTT
- MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices, optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks.
- Integration:
- Use the mqtt_client package.
- Set up an MQTT broker.
- Connect to the broker and subscribe to topics for real-time updates.

## Facade Design Pattern
- It is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to complex subsystems , 
- It defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use , hiding the complexities of the underlying system

```dart
// Component classes

class DVDPlayer {
  void on() => print("DVD Player is ON");
  void play(String movie) => print("Playing movie: $movie");
  void stop() => print("DVD Player stopped");
  void off() => print("DVD Player is OFF");
}

class Amplifier {
  void on() => print("Amplifier is ON");
  void setVolume(int level) => print("Amplifier volume set to $level");
  void off() => print("Amplifier is OFF");
}

class Projector {
  void on() => print("Projector is ON");
  void wideScreenMode() => print("Projector in widescreen mode");
  void off() => print("Projector is OFF");
}

// Facade class

class HomeTheaterFacade {
  final DVDPlayer dvdPlayer;
  final Amplifier amplifier;
  final Projector projector;

  HomeTheaterFacade(this.dvdPlayer, this.amplifier, this.projector);

  void watchMovie(String movie) {
    print("Get ready to watch a movie...");
    dvdPlayer.on();
    dvdPlayer.play(movie);
    amplifier.on();
    amplifier.setVolume(5);
    projector.on();
    projector.wideScreenMode();
  }

  void endMovie() {
    print("Shutting movie theater down...");
    dvdPlayer.stop();
    dvdPlayer.off();
    amplifier.off();
    projector.off();
  }
}

// Client code

void main() {
  var dvdPlayer = DVDPlayer();
  var amplifier = Amplifier();
  var projector = Projector();
  var homeTheater = HomeTheaterFacade(dvdPlayer, amplifier, projector);

  homeTheater.watchMovie("Inception");
  print("");
  homeTheater.endMovie();
}
```

A single TCP connection refers to a communication link established between two devices (e.g., a client and a server) 
over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures data is delivered 
in order and without errors.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of a single TCP connection:

Key Characteristics of a Single TCP Connection:
Connection Establishment (Three-Way Handshake):

Before data is transmitted, a single TCP connection is established using a three-step handshake process:
SYN: The client sends a synchronization (SYN) packet to the server.
SYN-ACK: The server responds with a synchronization acknowledgment (SYN-ACK).
ACK: The client sends an acknowledgment (ACK) to confirm the connection is established.

Data Transfer:

After the connection is established, data can flow in both directions between the client and the server.
TCP ensures reliable data delivery by using sequence numbers, acknowledgments, and retransmission mechanisms.

Connection Termination (Four-Way Handshake):

The connection is terminated using a four-step process:
The device initiating the termination sends a FIN packet.
The other device acknowledges it with an ACK.
The receiving device sends its own FIN packet.
The initiator acknowledges it with an ACK, closing the connection.
Persistence of Connection:

Once established, a single TCP connection persists until it is explicitly terminated or closed.
It can be reused for multiple data exchanges (e.g., in HTTP/1.1 with persistent connections).
Use Cases of a Single TCP Connection:
Web Browsing: A browser establishes a single TCP connection to a web server to fetch resources.
File Transfers: Applications like FTP use TCP connections to ensure reliable file delivery.
Secure Communication: Protocols like HTTPS and SSH rely on a single TCP connection for secure and encrypted communication.
Streaming: TCP connections can be used in applications like video streaming when reliability is crucial.
Advantages:
Reliability: Ensures no data loss or corruption.
Orderly Delivery: Data is received in the same order it was sent.
Error Control: Detects and corrects errors in transmission.
Disadvantages:
Overhead: TCP's reliability features (e.g., error checking and acknowledgment) add latency and resource usage.
Slower Start-Up: Establishing a connection involves a three-way handshake, which can add delays.
